# Features
- This flex pcb can be used to support an aftermarket battery terminal if the OEM battery terminal is corroded or broken
- This flex pcb can also be used to replace the existing footprint for the OEM battery terminal if it has been ripped

# Disclaimer
Even though is board was made to be extremely easy, it still does require some basic soldering skill to build and a basic understanding of electronics to test. I am by no means a professional electronics engineer and only do this as a hobby, if you see any improvements that you would like to make; feel free to fork the repo.

Troubleshooting is done at my discretion, the design is simple enough that it will either work or not. I am not responsible for blown fuses, fires, injuries, etc. that may happen if things are done incorrectly.

# Ordering
The board can be downloaded and ordered at any PCB manufacturer of your choice, if you choose to use PCBWay through my shared project link, I get a small commission. These can be ordered in FLEX PCB.

# Bill of Materials & Assembly
The aftermarket terminal: [3 pin battery terminal](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/C22464782.html)

The flex PCB sits directly on top of the existing battery terminal footprint. The bottom two mounting nubs on the aftermarket terminal need to be snipped off so that it sits flush on the PCB. I also remove the middle pin with a pair of pliers but it is not necessary(the pin is unused.) I also find it best to solder on the aftermarket battery terminal to the flex pcb before soldering it on top of the existing battery terminal footprint.
